# SlideshowManager
A virtual slideshow that allows you to add and remove "photos" to a slideshow and arrange them in different orders. 
The idea of this project was to demonstrate an understanding of stacks, because the user has the ability to undo and 
redo changes made to the slide show.


Run application via SlideshowManager.java
